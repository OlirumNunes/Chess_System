This project is a Java-based implementation of a chess game. It includes a comprehensive set of classes and interfaces
to represent the game's components, such as the board, pieces, and their movements.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:

- `application`: Contains the main classes and interfaces for the chess game.
- `boardgame`: It contains the logical control of the board, its pieces, and their positions.
- `chess`: It contains the logic of chess, the match, and the pieces.

## Main Classes and Interfaces

1. `Color.java`: Enum representing the colors of the chess pieces (black and white).
2. `Program`: The program manages a game of chess, allowing moves, piece captures, and complex logic such as en passant and checkmate.
